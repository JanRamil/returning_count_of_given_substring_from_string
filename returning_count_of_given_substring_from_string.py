# Creating a code for the given string
str_x = "Ramil is so pogi, Ramil is maganda, Ramil is smart, Ramil is kind, Ramil is family centered, Ramil is God centered, Ramil loves everyone around him, and Ramil is the best friend that you can have!"

# Creating the code for the substring 
cnt = str_x.count("Ramil")

# Creating  code to print on how many times did the string repeated
print(cnt)
